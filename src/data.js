It’s flavorful, it’s veg-loaded and fresh, but it’s also extremely comforting, unassuming, and mellow. And I think we could all use a little more mellow right about now, yes?",

Intuitively, I was drawn in, and an awakening occurred and then healing manifested itself. I saw before me the subtle, pervasive intuition and intent to journey down a path that would later start the holistic transformation and unification of mind, body and soul and my inner light. The thought and desire had always been there but in every prior chapter of my life it had been momentarily interrupted by what I later came to realize was my own arrested development.",
